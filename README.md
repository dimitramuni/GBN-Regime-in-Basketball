# Regime Based Analysis using Gated Bayesian Network
**An implementation of Gated Bayesian Network for Basketball Team**

# Abstract :
In a dynamic sport of professional basketball, a team may encounter several tangible and intangible alteration, regime detection, a widely used in the domain of financial market decision making and medical treatment planning, may assist a team management personnel to gain insight into how a team is changing with passage of time based on historical data. In this project, we have explored how multiple Bayesian networks could model the dynamics for a certain time frame. We have utilised basketball records starting from season 1980-81 to season 2000-21 for two NBA teams, Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons. Our finding have been visualised along with historical evidence which help provide insight into which parameter may be important for a certain period of team history.
